    <p>
      Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving over water. It is distinguished
      from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of
      blades on the paddle. A kayak is a low-to-the-water, canoe-like boat in
      which the paddler sits facing forward, legs in front, using a
      double-bladed paddle to pull front-to-back on one side and then the other
      in rotation. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top and
      inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well. 1. Zanskar River, Leh
      · 2. Nagin Lake, Srinagar · 3. The Ganges, Rishikesh · 4. Mandovi, Goa are
      some kayaking zones in india

    <p>
      Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying
      paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with
      no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in
      a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is
      maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in
      the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over
      the outside. Manali, Bir Billing, Kamshet in Maharashtra, Sanasar in
      Rajasthan, are some paragliding places in india
