        Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations.
        Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus,
        airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one
        way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays
        between successive movements.

      <p>
        Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice
        of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining
        tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be
        international, or within the traveler's country. The World Tourism
        Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond
        the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity
        only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual
        environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business
        and other purposes".

      <p>
        An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a
        bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures
        may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as
        traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river
        rafting or participating in extreme sports. Adventures may also include
        activities with an uncertain outcome such as visiting new places,
        meeting new people, and having new experiences.
